        <h2>Problem statement: Students have trouble keeping track of everything they have scheduled as there is a lot going on in everyoneâ€™s day-to-day.</h2>
        <p>
          It is hard to find where all of the events happen, as everything is in separate locations (GarnetGate, USC website, flyers). In other words, there is no simple way to know everything that is happening.
